(Government, Care Givers, People) are equal stakeholders in addressing the covid19. Blockchain can provide a central platform for all parties to communicate and share data and generate real-time insights

The exponential nature of the Coronavirus spread means that the only way to control is via deliberate and fault-tolerant tracking mechanism.
Blockchain can fulfill that promise. By design, Blockchain is a decentralized, fault-tolerant system that offers effective tracking capabilities across multiple parties. 
Blockchain can not only slow down the spread of the Coronavirus but also help healthcare professionals monitor the efficacy of the treatment across a large scale population.
Issues we are trying to solve – 
1. The government’s ability to test, cure and monitor ever-increasing cases is going to be exhausted at a certain point in time (often referred to as flattening the curve). It also means that private parties need to pitch in, with the onus on self-reporting and primary care. 
2. More participation from private parties (either for testing or providing care) can also lead to a lack of standard care along with disparate data standards. So we are providing a single platform for all stakeholders
3. As more and more people put under observations/quarantine, it puts the onus on the end-users to self-report and cure. 
4. The sheer size of our country in addition to the projected large-scale population augmented by lack of caregiving standards only will exaggerate the above issues.
